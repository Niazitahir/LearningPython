To get started with python, you need to understand 2 key things about coding:

1. Syntax

Syntax is how the coder (you) will write down exactly what they want the computer to do. Think of it like a language. The way you would say "Hi, what is your name" in English would be
way different than how you would say it in French! ("Salut, comment t'appelle tu?")

Example: 

You want the computer to print the addition between two numbers A and B;

You would do this simply by first setting the values of A and B, adding them, then printing them!

A = 1
B = 2
sum = A + B
print("A + B =", sum)


2. Data types and Classes

Python is a special type of coding language. Its versatile and easier to code in because you don't need to explictly state what each variable's "type" is. 

A data type defines what the actual variable is. A string is a collection of characters, and will therefor be treated as such ("Hello" is a string, 2 is not).

An integer (like in math) is a Real number with no decimals. Think numbers that you can count with. 

A list is a collection of variables. 

Data types can and will become more complex with time, but thats for later. 



Knowing this, my suggested material to learn from for the basics of python is the CodeAcademy Free Python class linked below:

It won't teach you anything fancy, but it will help you dip your toes into the world of coding with solid examples and the chance to code on your own.
