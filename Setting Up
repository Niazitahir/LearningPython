So, now you know how to understand and write a little bit of python and want to start your own project? 

Good. 

Now is where you download python and set up your VSCode (my favorite Code editor).


Downloading python is simple. In fact your computer probably comes with it preinstalled. However to keep up to date with the newest features and safety measures, 
go to: 

https://www.python.org/downloads/

Now download the version that corresponds to the Operating System (OS) you have on your computer (Windows, Mac, Linux etc.)

Follow the instructions and you should have python downloaded! (Contact me if anything goes wrong). 




Next, download VScode. VSCode is a code editor used by professionals world wide, and is easy to use. 

https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Once you are finished downloading the app, go to "Extensions" (on the left side bar, the Icon with a disassembled grid)

From there, download the following extensions:
1. Python (duh) <--- [the only "Necessary" one]
2. Python Extension Pack
3. Python Environment Manager
4. Python Extended

Once finished, try it out! Go to "Files" and open a folder. In that folder, create a new file called "Anything.py". The ".py" at the end specifies that this is a python script and will execute as such. 
Code whatever you want and when you're done, press the play button on the top right.
